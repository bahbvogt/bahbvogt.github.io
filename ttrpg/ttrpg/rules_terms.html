						<h1 id="rules_terms">Rules & Terms</h1>
						These are the rules. Ultimately enforced per the DM’s interpretation.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="ability_checks">Ability Checks</h2>
						To make an ability check, roll 1d20 + the relevant
						<a  href="#ability_scores">ability score</a>
						and
						<a  href="#skills">skill</a>
						(if applicable).The DM will interpret the result.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h3 id="contests">Contests</h3>
						When two characters are competing against each other with mutually exclusive goals, they
						bothmake an ability check. The character who gets the higher result succeeds.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
						Whenever a situation becomes hostile, and members of two or more parties are attempting
						toinflict physical harm upon one another, combat begins and those involved enter
						<a  href="#initiative">initiative</a>.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h3 id="combat_actions">Actions</h3>
						On each character’s turn, they can perform 1 action and move a number of feet less than or
						equalto their movement. A character cannot move more than their movement in a single round.
						<br />
						<br />
						Every character has access to the following actions.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Attack (varies).</b>
						Attack another character within range. Your initiative is equal to the damage die of yourwielded
						weapon (
						<i>i.e.</i>
						your initiative is 1d6 when wielding a club) unless otherwise noted.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Cast Spell (varies).</b>
						Cast a spell you have prepared using a number of unexpended spell dice you have. Your
						initiativeis equal to the spell dice you spent (
						<i>i.e.</i>
						your initiative is 2d6 when casting a spell with 2d6 spell dice) unless otherwise noted.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Defend (1d4).</b>
						Gain +2 to AR until the beginning of your next turn.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Help (1d6).</b>
						Help another non-hostile character. The character you aid gains advantage on the next
						abilitycheck they make to perform the task you are helping with, provided that they make the
						checkbefore the start of your next turn.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Run (1d6).</b>
						Double your movement speed until the end of the round.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Reevaluate (varies).</b>
						Choose a new action to perform on your turn and roll initiative. Add your new initiative to
						yourcurrent initiative.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="dungeon_crawling">Dungeon Crawling</h2>
						Time is important when crawling through a dungeon. Hostile characters roam the halls, andtorches
						only burn so long. As such, time is kept in cycles.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h3 id="dungeon_cycles">Cycles</h3>
						Each cycle lasts 10 minutes and follows the following sequence of events:
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td class="key">1</td>
								<td class="keydesc">
									<b>Wandering Monsters.</b>
									The DM rolls to see if you encounter anything.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="key">2</td>
								<td class="keydesc">
									<b>Actions.</b>
									Players decide what
									<a  href="#dungeon_actions">actions</a>
									to take.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="key">3</td>
								<td class="keydesc">
									<b>Description.</b>
									The DM narrates what happens.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="key">4</td>
								<td class="keydesc">
									<b>End of Cycle.</b>
									The DM and players update any time-sensitive records, such as spell durations,
									torchfuel, et cetera.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<br />
						<h3 id="dungeon_actions">Actions</h3>
						Each character can make 1 action per cycle.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Move (1 cycle).</b>
						Move a number of feet equal to half your movement speed. Attempting to move faster will
						increasethe chance of wandering monsters (rolled once every cycle and encountered on a roll of
						1-3) andwill not allow you to notice traps (which will activate if you run into them).
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Rest (6 cycles).</b>
						Benefit from a short rest. The hostile nature of dungeons prevents long rests.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Search (1 cycle).</b>
						Declare a 10-by-10-foot area to search. Make a Focus check to determine what you discover.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Other (1+ cycles).</b>
						This can be anything else you could reasonably do in a dungeon: loot a room, scratch
						graffitiinto the ancient walls, cast a spell, consult the strange crystal ball in the middle of
						theroom, et cetera! Consult your DM to determine if an action is possible and how many cycles
						itwill take to complete.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="damage">Damage</h2>
						When you deal damage with an ability, weapon, spell, or anything else, you roll the
						specifieddamage dice and add any appropriate modifiers. This is how much damage you deal to your
						targetor targets (before resistances).
						<br />
						<br />
						Damage is subtracted from the target’s
						<a  href="#hit_points">HP</a>.
						<br />
						<br />
						It is possible to deal 0 damage, but no less.
						<br />
						<br />
						Each time a character takes damage and is left with 0 or fewer hit points, they gain a level of
						<a  href="#exhaustion">exhaustion</a>
						and fall
						<a  href="#prone">prone</a>
						if they aren't already.
						<br />
						<br />
						When attacking with a weapon, you add your Strength modifier to the damage unless
						otherwisenoted. Spells and abilities will specify any modifiers.
						<br />
						<br />
						When you deal damage to more than one target with one action, roll the damage once and apply it
						to all targets.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h3 id="damage_modifiers">Modifiers</h3>
						In certain circumstances, damage may be calculated differently.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Critical Hits.</b>
						When you roll the highest result on a damage die, you may roll an additional damage die of
						thesame size and add it to the result.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Resistance.</b>
						If you have resistance to a type of damage, you reduce any incoming damage of that type by half.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Vulnerability.</b>
						If you have vulnerability to a type of damage, you double any incoming damage of that type.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="exhaustion">Exhaustion</h2>
						Exhaustion has 4 levels. Whenever you take a level of exhaustion, you incur the penalty of
						yourcurrent level of exhaustion in addition to all the levels below your current level.
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td class="key">1</td>
								<td class="keydesc">Your speed is halved.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="key">2</td>
								<td class="keydesc">Your HP maximum is halved.</td>
							</tr>

								<td class="key">3</td>
								<td class="keydesc">

								<td class="keydesc">
									You are
									<a  href="#dead">dead</a>.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="inventory">Inventory</h2>
						Inventory slots represent how much physical weight you can carry. The number of inventory
						slotsyou have is equal to 10 + STR, to a minimum of the number of hands you have.
						<br />
						<br />
						Regardless of how many inventory slots you have, if you don’t have a bag to hold your stuff
						in,you can only hold a maximum of 1 item per hand.
						<br />
						<br />
						Each item will say how many slots it takes up. Most items will take up one slot (like
						aone-handed weapon) and larger items will take of two (like a two-handed weapon) or more.
						<br />
						<br />
						Multiple bundled items can be carried in one slot, defined by the item. Items can only bebundled
						with other items that are reasonably similar.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h3 id="quick_slots">Quick Slots</h3>
						The items you carry take an action to retrieve from your bag unless they are stored in a
						quickslot. The number of your inventory slots that are quick slots is equal to 4 + DEX, to a
						minimumof the number of hands you have and a maximum of the number of inventory slots you have.
						<br />
						<br />
						An item that occupies a quick slot and a non-quick slot is treated as if it occupies a
						non-quickslot.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h3 id="encumbrance">Encumbrance</h3>
						You must make a saving throw versus exhaustion every 15 minutes to carry more items than youhave
						slots. You make this roll minus the number of extra slots you’re attempting to carry.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="initiative">Initiative</h2>
						Initiative is used whenever the order in which actions are taken matters. This typically
						happenswhenever the passing of seconds becomes important (i.e. whenever things start to happen
						all atonce). The most common time initiative is used is during combat or when a trap is
						triggered, butit can be used for things like games or heated conversations as well.
						<br />
						<br />
						During initiative, time is measured in rounds, which are further divided into turns.
						Unlessotherwise noted, each participant in initiative has one turn per round. Each round takes
						aboutsix seconds in game time, so each minute has ten rounds.
						<br />
						<br />
						At the beginning of every round, each character decides which action they will take on
						theirturn. Then, everyone rolls initiative, which determines the order of actions for the round.
						Thedie you roll for initiative is determined by your chosen action. Lower numbers go first. In
						caseof a tie, the character with higher Dexterity goes first, and in case of further ties,
						thecharacter who rolled the smaller die for initiative goes first. Any further ties are
						determinedby the DM.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h2 id="resting">Resting</h2>
						<h3 id="siesta">Siesta</h3>
						You can spend 1 uninterrupted hour at any time to take a siesta. This allows you and your
						partyto lick your wounds and decompress. You may regain a number of
						<a  href="#hit_points">hit points</a>
						equal to half your HP maximum at the end of a siesta.
						<br />
						<br />
						<h3 id="full_rest">Full Rest</h3>
						You can spend 8 uninterrupted hours at any time to take a full rest. This allows you and
						yourparty to fully recover. You regain all your
						<a  href="#hit_points">hit points</a>
						and
						<a  href="#spell_dice">spell dice</a>
						at the end of a full rest.
