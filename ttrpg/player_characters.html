						You start with 6 skill points (in addition to any you get from your hometown), which you
						can distribute however you like among 2-6 skills. A skill you invest 1 point in becomes a +1
						skill,and so on.

						general guideline, anything that could conceivably be a college major makes a good skill. If you
						make your own, they must be approved by your DM before play.
